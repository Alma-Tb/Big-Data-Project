This dataset contains data from a higher education institution on
various variables related to undergraduate students, including
demographics, social-economic factors, and academic performance, to
investigate the impact of these factors on student dropout and academic
success.

# Project Description
In this project we are trying to explore and detect
the factors that are affecting the student's potential in successfully
graduating and developing models that can detect whether a
student will graduate or drop out. 

# The Key Objectives
1. Identify Predictors of Student Dropout: Analyze demographic and socio-economic
factors such as age, gender, marital status, and application mode to identify potential
predictors of student dropout across different undergraduate degree programs.
2. Analyze Academic Performance Factors: Explore the relationship between academic
performance indicators such as curricular units credited, enrolled, evaluated,
approved, and grades with student retention and success rates.
3. Investigate Economic Influences: Examine the impact of regional economic factors
such as unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP on student dropout rates and
academic success outcomes.
4. Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast student dropout and
academic success based on the identified factors, leveraging machine learning
algorithms and statistical techniques.
5. Disciplinary Variances: Investigate disciplinary variances by analyzing dropout and
academic success patterns across diverse undergraduate degree programs including
agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and
technologies.
